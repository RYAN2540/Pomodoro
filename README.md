## Podomoro

Your office is full of workaholics. No one takes breaks, No one goes for lunch, and the only interesting thing that you can ever talk about with your workmates, are the new cool updates on Slack.

Your team lead is afraid at this pace people will start burning out soon. He contracts you to build an application that will remind your coworkers to take a break.

The team came up with this Cool app POMODORO TIMER, one is able to login, add the todo list or the
task one should handle with the set given by POMODORO timer. Plus a setting up for exapmle a 5min
break until finishing the task or todo.
